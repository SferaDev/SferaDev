IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning for any task.

Use the available skills, you can find and install new skills with `npx skills` CLI.

Prefer popular libraries, rather than trying to implement complex functionality from scratch. You can install new packages if needed, just make sure they are well-maintained and useful.

Instead of writing types or complex logic, use the types and helpers provided by the installed packages.

We want full type-safety, we don't like type casting, use proper types and interfaces.

When writing code, prefer readability and maintainability over cleverness or brevity. Avoid glue code that is hard to understand.

When you need to make assumptions, use common sense and standard best practices.
