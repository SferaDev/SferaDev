## Installation

Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SferaDev.vscode-extension-vercel-ai):

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + X`)
3. Search for "Vercel AI Gateway"
4. Click Install

Or install via the command line:

```bash
code --install-extension SferaDev.vscode-extension-vercel-ai
```

## Authentication

The extension supports two authentication methods:

### API Key Authentication

The simplest way to authenticate is with a Vercel AI Gateway API key:

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`)
2. Search for "Vercel AI Gateway: Manage Authentication"
3. Select "API Key"
4. Enter your API key (starts with `vck_`)

<Note>
  You can obtain an API key from the [Vercel AI Gateway dashboard](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway).
</Note>

### OIDC Authentication (Vercel CLI)

For enhanced security, you can use OIDC authentication via the Vercel CLI:

1. Ensure you're logged in to the Vercel CLI (`vercel login`)
2. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`)
3. Search for "Vercel AI Gateway: Manage Authentication"
4. Select "Vercel OIDC"
5. Choose your team and project

OIDC tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire.

## Usage

Once authenticated, the extension automatically registers as a language model provider in VS Code.

### Using with VS Code Chat

1. Open the Chat panel (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + I`)
2. Click the model selector dropdown
3. Choose a model from "Vercel AI Gateway"
4. Start chatting!

### Using with GitHub Copilot Chat

The extension integrates with GitHub Copilot Chat, allowing you to use Vercel AI Gateway models as an alternative to the default Copilot models.

## Available Models

The extension dynamically fetches available models from the Vercel AI Gateway. Supported models include:

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4 Turbo |
| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Haiku |
| Google | Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash |
| And more... | All models supported by Vercel AI Gateway |

All models support:
- Text generation with streaming
- Tool calling (where supported by the underlying model)
- Token counting

## Session Management

The extension supports multiple authentication sessions, allowing you to switch between different API keys or OIDC configurations.

### Managing Sessions

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`)
2. Search for "Vercel AI Gateway: Manage Authentication"
3. Choose from:
   - **Add new authentication** - Add a new API key or OIDC session
   - **Switch active session** - Switch between existing sessions
   - **Remove session** - Delete a saved session
